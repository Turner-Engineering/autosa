# Autosa

Autosa is Tenco software used to automate data acquisition using a signal analyzer (the name is spelled "Autosa" or "autosa" and is read as a single word with a stress on the second syllable).

## Setup

Windows is the recommended operating system for AutosaVersion 2022 Q3. It has not been tested on other operating systems.

### Autosa Installation

**Autosa has only been tested on Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices**

This takes about 10 to 20 minutes, 1 reboot, and requires a decent internet connection.

1. Download and Install [NI-VISA](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-visa.html) for Windows (last tested version was 2023 Q3). This allows Autosa to communicate with the instrument. Please read the instructions below for extra guidance.
   1. The link above will take you to the This will download the NI Package Manager from which you will install NI-VISA.
   2. You will be asked to disable windows fast startup - do this, it only affects boot from shutdown and not by much.
   3. Deselect ALL when it asks about additional packages, Autosa does not need them.
2. Download the executable file [`Autosa.exe`](https://github.com/ThisTemba/autosa/releases/latest) from this repository
   1. This link takes you to the "releases" page of this repository. From here, click "Autosa.exe" under "Assets" to download the executable file.
   2. Autosa is not a "recognized" windows app, so you may get a warning about that, ignore the warning and run the executable. You may have to click "More Info" and then "Run Anyway" to get it to run.
3. Double click the executable file to run the program
   1. If the instrument is not connected, the program will start and say the instrument was not detected. See below for usage instructions

### Instrument Setup

1. Make sure the instrument is plugged in to power and turned on
2. Make sure the instrument is connected to this computer via USB-B (back of instrument) to USB-A (computer) cable. See image below.
3. Make sure the signal analyzer program is running on the device (called "LaunchXSA" on the desktop)

Required USB-B to USB-A cable

### Usage

To be written. Roughly:

1. There are three modes: manual, semi-automatic, and automatic
2. Manual mode is for when you want to start and stop the instrument manually
3. Semi-automatic mode is for when you want to run a band at a time automatically
4. Automatic mode is for when you want to run multiple bands in a row automatically
5. The main things Autosa does is load the state file, load the correction file, and save the trace and screenshot with the correct name

- It is best to set the local output folder to a cloud-synced folder like Dropbox or OneDrive so that the data is backed up automatically.

## Emulator Mode

To run Autosa in Emulator mode:
* Toggle `emulator_mode` to `true` in the `get_inst` function in [`instrument.py`](https://github.com/Turner-Engineering/autosa/blob/657f55e7287631352ad06e940d7c862862807254/src/instrument/instrument.py#L34C12-L34C79). This sets the `resource_name` to `TCPIP0::localhost::inst0::INSTR`
* Set the `resource_name` to `TCPIP0::localhost::inst0::INSTR` in [`pyvisa_pxa_screenshot.py`](https://github.com/Turner-Engineering/autosa/blob/657f55e7287631352ad06e940d7c862862807254/src/instrument/pyvisa_pxa_screenshot.py#L37)

This will be simplified in future versions of autosa (written while v0.4.0 was in pre-release)


## Development

### Guiding Principles

This software is written to be as "plug-and-play" as possible. The more set up steps are required to use the software, the less likely it is to be used. This is why it comes packaged as an `.exe` file that just needs to be downloaded and double clicked. In this vein, all user interfaces should be as self-explanatory as possible.

Different levels of automation are available for differing comfort levels and use-cases. The most automated mode performs up to 5 runs in a row with no intervention. This is good for surveys, when everything is set up correctly and the procedure is merely repeated at each site. The least automated mode functions almost as an extension of the instrument's physical interface, allowing the user to start, stop, and save data manually. This is good for railcar EMC tests where timing varies and tests are repeated depending on the results.

### Packages

The following packages are required for development:

- [pysimplegui](https://www.pysimplegui.org/en/latest/) - creating user interface
- [pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) - compiling python scripts `.exe` file
- [pyvisa](https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - communicating with the instrument over USB

Install all three with pip:

```bash
pip install pysimplegui pyinstaller pyvisa
```

### Building

This project uses [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) to convert the python scripts and packages into a single, distributable `.exe` file.

The build is done by executing the `build.py` file. The output executable (`.exe`) file will be located in `root/install/dist`. The `/install/build` folder are the temporary files used by PyInstaller to create the executable. I don't know what the `.spec` file is, but it doesn't seem to be required to run the executable.

### N9010B Reference Docs

Autosa was written to work with the N9010B signal analyzer. The [User's and Programmer's Reference](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/assets/9018-04666/user-manuals/9018-04666.pdf) was used to develop the SCPI commands.

### Terminology

`band_ori` = "v", "h"

## Real World Tests

### October 2023

Tenco used Autosa in the field for the first time on October 18th 2023 for railcar tests.

Tenco used Autosa in January 2024 for the NYCT Crane Car Test in New York City.

Tenco used Autosa in January 2024 for the Toshiba Electric Locomotive Commissioning Tests in Taiwan.

Tenco used Autosa In April 2024 for P2250 Railcar Tests in Pueblo, Colorado.

## Notes

### May 24 2024

- added delay to run band, this should deal with the screenshotting of alerts with a small hit to time.

### June 5 2024

- Good thing that the file namer is based on the folders in the signal analyzer and not the folders on the test laptop. The test laptop can change within a single test, but only one SA will be used.
